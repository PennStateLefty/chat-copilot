has demonstrated none of these benefits.  Navigation to data\ngrids representing major entities, such as customer, do a complete pull\nfrom the server tables.  The amount of time taken to response, and\ncorrespondingly the amount of data returned, are proportional to the\ntotal number of records in the database.  Based on the current FNFG\nportfolio, roughly 1/8 the size of Key\u0027s, the response time is nearly\n20s. for customer table pulls and the thick-client memory commitment is\nnearly a quarter of a gigabyte.\n\nAs with most back office banking functions the Aspire platform is built\non the concept of \u0022end of day\u0022 and \u0022end of month\u0022 processes and batches.\nThe current FNFG portfolio is able to fit within the batch windows\nallotted, however, there is limited overhead for growth.  These \u0022end of\n*\u0022 services run on applications servers.  In the version of Aspire which\nFNFG runs on there is a dispatcher, triggering jobs based on a defined\nsequence to a defined service.  The services can be deployed on\ndifferent servers in the event load could impact other services deployed\non the same box, however, scaling is not necessarily linear.  The\nunderlying data structure, and the application code, are not optimized\nfor running in parallel.  As such, in the version running at FNFG, the\nonly real scaling potential is vertical and mainly at the database\nlevel.  The current versions of the Aspire product have done some things\nto address this scaling concern.  Introduction of a Job Stream queue\nenables the dispatcher to break free of sequential execution. \nAdditionally, efforts have been made to \u0022shard\u0022 data across two\ndimensions, Finance Company and Date, in order to allow multiple\ninstances of the same job to execute across a data set.  The vendor has\nstated that database I/O remains the biggest impediment to scaling\ndespite these changes.\n\nAuthentication:"}}
